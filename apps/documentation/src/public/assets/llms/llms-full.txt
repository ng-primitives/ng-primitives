## Getting-started

### Get Started

File: getting-started/get-started.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/getting-started/get-started

# Get Started

## Installation

Angular Primitives is distributed as a single package with entrypoints for each primitive.
This makes it easy to install and update, while keeping the bundle size as small as possible.

<tab-group>
  <tab-item label="Angular CLI">
    To install Angular Primitives using the Angular CLI, run the following command:

```bash npm
ng add ng-primitives
```

This command will install Angular Primitives and add the necessary dependencies to your project.

  </tab-item>

  <tab-item label="Nx">
    To install Angular Primitives using Nx, run the following command:

```bash npm
nx add ng-primitives
```

This command will install Angular Primitives and add the necessary dependencies to your project.

  </tab-item>

  <tab-item label="Manual Installation">
    
To manually install Angular Primitives, run the following command:

```bash npm
npm i ng-primitives
```

## Peer Dependencies

Angular Primitives relies on a few peer dependencies that need to be installed. If you are using NPM version 7 or higher, these dependencies will be installed automatically. If you are using an older version of NPM, or a different package manager, you may need to install them manually.

| Package          | Version  |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| @angular/cdk     | >=20.0.0 |
| @floating-ui/dom | >=1.6.0  |

To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm i @angular/cdk@^21.0.0 @floating-ui/dom@^1.6.0
```

  </tab-item>
</tab-group>

## Usage

Once Angular Primitives is installed, you can start using the primitives in your Angular application.
It is best to create a reusable component that encapsulates the primitives, so that you can easily reuse it throughout your application.

Primitives can be used both within a template or as a host directive on a component giving you the flexibility to choose the best approach for your use case.

Primitives add `data-` attributes to the elements they are applied to based on their current state. This allows you to easily style the primitives using CSS without having to rely on JavaScript.

# Introduction

Angular Primitives is a low-level headless UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization, and developer experience. Whether you're building a robust design system from scratch or looking to enhance your existing one, our primitives are here to support you every step of the way.

## Key Features

1. **Accessibility First:** We believe that all users should have equal access to information and functionality. Our primitives are crafted with accessibility best practices, ensuring that your applications are inclusive and usable by everyone.

2. **Customization Made Easy:** We understand the importance of maintaining a consistent look and feel across your applications. With Angular Primitives, we don't provide any styles, you provide your own to seamlessly blend with your brand's identity and visual guidelines.

3. **Developer Experience:** We know developers value simplicity and efficiency. Our library is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, making it a breeze for you to integrate and work with our primitives in your Angular projects. We follow the best practices and standards to ensure the highest quality code and documentation and support SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and Zoneless out of the box.

## Versioning

Angular Primitives follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). As a result you can expect the following:

- **Patch releases** contain bug fixes and minor improvements.
- **Minor releases** contain new features and improvements.
- **Major releases** contain breaking changes.

We release a new major version each time Angular releases a new major version.
This ensures that Angular Primitives is always up-to-date with the latest Angular features and best practices.

## Compatibility

Angular Primitives versions are compatible with the following Angular versions:

| Angular Primitives | Angular        |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| 0.1.0 - 0.18.0     | 18.x.x         |

### Styling

File: getting-started/styling.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/getting-started/styling

# Styling

Unlike traditional component libraries, Angular Primitives doesn't come with any built-in styles. This is because no matter how flexible a component library's theming system is, it can never meet the needs of every project or design system.

Angular Primitives gives you a set of basic building blocks that you can structure however you want, letting you style them exactly as you like.

Sure, this means you'll need to put in more effort than you would with an off the shelf component library. If you're just looking to quickly build something without worrying much about its appearance, Angular Primitives might not be the best fit. But if you want a way to quickly create custom components that look and behave exactly the way you want, Angular Primitives is a great choice.

## Approach

Angular Primitives has an opinionated way of handling styling. Each primitive uses `data-*` attributes to reflect its important state. This lets you style the primitives based on their state using CSS, so you don't have to manually toggle classes.

This works with any styling system, whether you're using plain CSS, SCSS, or a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.

## Example

If you are using CSS or SCSS, you can style the primitives like this:

```scss
button[data-selected] {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

button[data-disabled] {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

If you are using Tailwind CSS, you can style the primitives like this:

```html
<button
  class="data-disabled:cursor-not-allowed data-disabled:opacity-50 data-selected:bg-blue-500 data-selected:text-white"
  ngpToggle
>
  Toggle
</button>
```

### Usage

File: getting-started/usage.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/getting-started/usage

# Usage

Angular Primitives are built entirely using Angular directives, offering a flexible and composable way to enhance your components.

There are two main ways to use them:

- Apply the directives directly in your component templates.
- Use the directives as **host directives** in your own components.

Let’s explore both approaches, along with some limitations and the solutions we provide.

---

## Using Directives in Templates

To use a directive in a template, simply apply it to the element you want to enhance. For example, here’s how you might use the `ngpSwitch` directive:

```html
<button
  ngpSwitch
  [ngpSwitchChecked]="isChecked()"
  (ngpSwitchCheckedChange)="onSwitchChange($event)"
>
  <span ngpSwitchThumb></span>
</button>
```

This applies the `ngpSwitch` directive to the button, enabling correct behavior and accessibility. You have full control over the inputs and outputs, making this approach ideal for many use cases.

However, this method has a few limitations. Some directives — like `ngpButton` — are intended to be used on specific elements (e.g. `button`). Wrapping such elements in your own component can make it difficult for consumers to add attributes like `type`, since you'd need to expose every possible attribute as an input manually.

To solve this, you can use **host directives**.

## Using Directives as Host Directives

Host directives let you enhance your components by attaching existing directives at the class level. Here's how you can use `ngpButton` as a host directive:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';

@Component({
  selector: 'button[my-button]',
  template: `
    <ng-content />
  `,
  hostDirectives: [NgpButton],
})
export class MyButtonComponent {
  // You can add any additional inputs or outputs you want here
}
```

This approach allows consumers to apply attributes directly to the `button` element while still benefiting from the functionality provided by the directive.

You can also expose specific inputs and outputs from the directive to your component. For example:

```typescript
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';

@Component({
  selector: 'button[my-button]',
  template: `
    <ng-content />
  `,
  hostDirectives: [{ directive: NgpButton, inputs: ['disabled'] }],
})
export class MyButtonComponent {}
```

This lets consumers bind to the `disabled` input just as if they were using `ngpButton` directly.

## Limitations & Solutions

### Programmatically setting inputs

A key limitation of host directives in Angular is that their inputs can't be set programmatically within the component. To address this, we provide two main solutions:

#### Config Providers

Some directives support configuration providers that let you set default values. For example, to configure the default expansion type for `ngpAccordion`:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-accordion',
  template: `
    <ng-content />
  `,
  hostDirectives: [{ directive: NgpAccordion, inputs: ['type'] }],
  providers: [provideAccordionConfig({ type: 'multiple' })],
})
export class MyAccordionComponent {}
```

Consumers can still override this default by explicitly binding to the `type` input.

#### State Providers

Other directives provide a **state provider**, allowing you to programmatically control their inputs. For example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpSwitch, injectSwitchState } from 'ng-primitives/switch';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-switch',
  template: `
    <ng-content />
  `,
  hostDirectives: [NgpSwitch],
})
export class MySwitchComponent {
  private readonly state = injectSwitchState();

  constructor() {
    this.state.checked.set(true);
  }
}
```

Internally, all directive inputs are converted into **linked signals**, enabling both binding and programmatic updates.

### Splitting into Multiple Components

Some features are best implemented as multiple components. Take an accordion, for example:

```html
<my-accordion>
  <my-accordion-item label="Item 1">
    <p>Content for item 1</p>
  </my-accordion-item>

  <my-accordion-item label="Item 2">
    <p>Content for item 2</p>
  </my-accordion-item>
</my-accordion>
```

If you're using `ngpAccordion` as a directive in the `my-accordion` template, the child `my-accordion-item` components won’t be able to locate it in the dependency injection tree. This is a known Angular limitation.

To solve this, Angular Primitives supports **state hoisting**, which allows you to share directive state between components.

#### State Hoisting Example

To hoist the state of `ngpAccordion` from the `my-accordion` component:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpAccordion, provideAccordionState } from 'ng-primitives/accordion';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-accordion',
  template: `
    <div ngpAccordion>
      <ng-content />
    </div>
  `,
  providers: [provideAccordionState()],
})
export class MyAccordionComponent {}
```

Now, child directives like `ngpAccordionItem` can correctly locate and interact with the hoisted `ngpAccordion` state.

## Interactions

### Focus Visible

File: interactions/focus-visible.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/interactions/focus-visible

# Focus Visible

Determine whether an element should display a visible focus indicator and exposes the origin of that focus (keyboard, mouse, touch, program).
This is useful for accessibility and user experience, as it allows you to provides accessible visual feedback aligned with the `:focus-visible` standard.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpFocusVisible } from 'ng-primitives/interactions';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-focus-visible',
  imports: [NgpFocusVisible],
  template: `
    <button ngpFocusVisible>Try focusing me!</button>
  `,
  styles: `
    button {
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      outline: none;
      height: 2.5rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      transition: background-color 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-shadow);
    }

    button[data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 2px;
    }
  `,
})
export default class FocusVisibleExample {}

```

## Import

Import the Focus Visible primitives from `ng-primitives/interactions`.

```ts
import { NgpFocusVisible } from 'ng-primitives/interactions';
```

## Usage

Assemble the focus-visible directives in your template.

```html
<div (ngpFocusVisible)="onFocusVisible($event)"></div>
```

## API Reference

The following directives are available to import from the `ng-primitives/interactions` package:

### NgpFocusVisible

## API Reference

### NgpFocusVisible

Apply the `ngpFocusVisible` directive to an element that should be visually focused. This is similar to `ngpFocus`
but it will only apply the focus visible styles when the element is focused via keyboard navigation.

**Selector:** `[ngpFocusVisible]`

#### Inputs

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ngpFocusVisibleDisabled` | `boolean` | `-` | Whether focus events are listened to. |

#### Outputs

| Event | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ngpFocusVisible` | `boolean` | Emit when the element is visually focused. |

#### Export As

`ngpFocusVisible`



#### Data Attributes

The following data attributes are applied to the `ngpFocusVisible` directive:

| Attribute            | Description                                                        | Value                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `data-focus-visible` | Applied when the element should display a visible focus indicator. | `keyboard \| mouse \| touch \| program` |

### Disabling Focus Visible Interaction

Many primitives automatically add focus handling to components. If you want to disable focus handling, either globally or on a per-component/per-directive basis, you can do so by registering the `provideInteractionConfig` provider and setting the `focusVisible` option to `false`.

```ts
import { provideInteractionConfig } from 'ng-primitives/interactions';

providers: [
  provideInteractionConfig({
    focusVisible: false,
  }),
],
```

  `,
})
export default class HoverExample {
  isHovering = signal(false);
}

```

## Import

Import the Hover primitive from `ng-primitives/interactions`.

```ts
import { NgpHover } from 'ng-primitives/interactions';
```

## Usage

Assemble the hover directives in your template.

```html
<div
  (ngpHover)="onHoverChange($event)"
  (ngpHoverStart)="onHoverStart()"
  (ngpHoverEnd)="onHoverEnd()"
></div>
```

## API Reference

The following directives are available to import from the `ng-primitives/interactions` package:

### NgpHover

## API Reference

### NgpHover

Apply the `ngpHover` directive to an element that you want to listen for hover events. T
his is particulaly useful for supporting hover events on touch devices, where hover events are not handled consistently.
On iOS relying on the `:hover` pseudo-class can result in the hover state being stuck until the user taps elsewhere on the screen.

**Selector:** `[ngpHover]`

#### Inputs

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ngpHoverDisabled` | `boolean` | `-` | Whether hoving should be disabled. |

#### Outputs

| Event | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ngpHoverStart` | `void` | Emit an event when hovering starts. |
| `ngpHoverEnd` | `void` | Emit an event when hovering ends. |
| `ngpHover` | `boolean` | Emit an event when the hover state changes. |

#### Export As

`ngpHover`



#### Data Attributes

| Attribute    | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `data-hover` | Added to the element when hovering occurs. |

### Disabling Hover Interaction

Many primitives automatically add hover handling to components. If you want to disable hover handling, either globally or on a per-component/per-directive basis, you can do so by registering the `provideInteractionConfig` provider and setting the `hover` option to `false`.

```ts
import { provideInteractionConfig } from 'ng-primitives/interactions';

providers: [
  provideInteractionConfig({
    hover: false,
  }),
],
```

## Global Configuration

You can configure the default options for all accordions in your application by using the `provideAccordionConfig` function in a providers array.

```ts
import { provideAccordionConfig } from 'ng-primitives/accordion';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideAccordionConfig({
      type: 'multiple',
      collapsible: true,
      orientation: 'horizontal',
    }),
  ],
});
```

### NgpAccordionConfig

<prop-details name="type" type="single | multiple">
  Define whether only one or multiple accordion items can be open at a time.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="collapsible" type="boolean">
  Define an accordion can be collapsed. This is only applicable when `type` is set to `single`.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="orientation" type="horizontal | vertical">
  Define the orientation of the accordion.
</prop-details>

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Accordion WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion).

Tip: Per APG, wrap each trigger button in a heading element (e.g., `h3`) or an element with `role="heading"` and an appropriate `aria-level`. Ensure the button is the only child of the heading.

### Keyboard Interactions

- <kbd>Space</kbd> - Toggle the expanded state of the accordion item when the trigger is focused.
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> - Toggle the expanded state of the accordion item when the trigger is focused.

### Hidden Until Found

The `ngpAccordionContent` primitive uses the `until-found` attribute to allow the browser to search text within the hidden region and reveal the section if a match is found. If the browser does not support this functionality, the attribute is ignored.

More information about the `until-found` attribute can be found on [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/?search=hidden%20until-found).

      display: inline-flex;
      width: 3rem;
      height: 3rem;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      border-radius: 9999px;
      border-width: 2px;
      border-color: var(--ngp-avatar-border);
      background-color: var(--ngp-avatar-background);
      vertical-align: middle;

  NgpBreadcrumbSeparator,
  NgpBreadcrumbEllipsis,
  NgpBreadcrumbPage,
} from 'ng-primitives/breadcrumbs';
```

## Usage

Assemble the directives to build the breadcrumb structure, applying your own `aria-label` to describe the navigation context. You can optionally wire the ellipsis into the Menu primitives to expose collapsed sections.

```html
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb" ngpBreadcrumbs>
  <ol ngpBreadcrumbList>
    <li ngpBreadcrumbItem>
      <a ngpBreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</a>
    </li>

    <li ngpBreadcrumbSeparator>/</li>

    <li ngpBreadcrumbItem>
      <button type="button" aria-label="Toggle breadcrumb menu">
        <span ngpBreadcrumbEllipsis>...</span>
      </button>
    </li>

    <li ngpBreadcrumbSeparator>/</li>

    <li ngpBreadcrumbItem>
      <a ngpBreadcrumbLink href="...">Components</a>
    </li>

    <li ngpBreadcrumbSeparator>/</li>

    <li ngpBreadcrumbItem>
      <span ngpBreadcrumbPage>Breadcrumbs</span>
    </li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

### Button

File: primitives/button.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/primitives/button

# Button

A button is a clickable element that can be used to trigger an action. This primitive enhances the native button element with improved accessibility and interaction handling for hover, press and focus.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-button',
  imports: [NgpButton],
  template: `
    <button ngpButton>Button</button>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpButton] {
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      border: none;
      height: 2.5rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      transition: background-color 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
    }

    [ngpButton][data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    [ngpButton][data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
    }

    [ngpButton][data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }
  `,
})
export default class ButtonExample {}

```

## Import

Import the Button primitives from `ng-primitives/button`.

```ts
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';
```

## Usage

Assemble the button directives in your template.

```html
<button ngpButton>Button</button>
```

## Reusable Component

Create a button component that uses the `NgpButton` directive.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component, input } from '@angular/core';

```

## Examples

### Button Sizes

You can add size support to your reusable button component. This is implemented at the component level rather than in the primitive to provide more flexibility for different design systems.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, input } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';

/**
 * The size of the button.
 */
export type ButtonSize = 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl';

@Component({
  selector: 'button[app-button]',
  hostDirectives: [{ directive: NgpButton, inputs: ['disabled'] }],
  template: '<ng-content />',
  host: {
    '[attr.data-size]': 'size()',
  },
  styles: `
    :host {
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      border: none;
      height: 2.5rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      transition: background-color 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    :host[data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    :host[data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
    }

    :host[data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }

    /* Size variants */
    :host[data-size='sm'] {
      height: 2rem;
      padding-left: 0.75rem;
      padding-right: 0.75rem;
      font-size: 0.875rem;
    }

    :host[data-size='md'],
    :host:not([data-size]) {
      height: 2.5rem;
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      font-size: 0.875rem;
    }

    :host[data-size='lg'] {
      height: 3rem;
      padding-left: 1.25rem;
      padding-right: 1.25rem;
      font-size: 1rem;
    }

    :host[data-size='xl'] {
      height: 3.5rem;
      padding-left: 1.5rem;
      padding-right: 1.5rem;
      font-size: 1.125rem;
    }
  `,
})
export class Button {
  /**
   * The size of the button.
   */
  readonly size = input<ButtonSize>('md');
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-button-sizes-example',
  imports: [Button],
  template: `
    <div class="button-container">
      <button size="sm" app-button>Small</button>
      <button app-button>Medium</button>
      <button size="lg" app-button>Large</button>
      <button size="xl" app-button>Extra Large</button>
    </div>

      align-items: center;
      gap: 1rem;
    }
  `,
})
export default class ButtonSizesExample {}

```

### Button Variants

You can add variant support to your reusable button component to indicate different purposes or importance levels.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, input } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';

/**
 * The variant of the button.
 */
export type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'link';

@Component({
  selector: 'button[app-button]',
  hostDirectives: [{ directive: NgpButton, inputs: ['disabled'] }],
  template: '<ng-content />',
  host: {
    '[attr.data-variant]': 'variant()',
  },
  styles: `
    :host {
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      border: none;
      height: 2.5rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      transition: background-color 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      box-sizing: border-box;
      display: inline-flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      cursor: pointer;
    }

### Button with Icons

You can add icons to your buttons using any Angular icon library or simple SVG elements, but we recommend the [`@ng-icons`](https://github.com/ng-icons/ng-icons) library. This example shows how to create buttons with icons on the leading, trailing, or both sides using content projection slots.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, input } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import {
  lucideArrowRight,
  lucideCheck,
  lucideChevronRight,
  lucideShoppingBasket,
} from '@ng-icons/lucide';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';

/**
 * The size of the button.
 */
export type ButtonSize = 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl';

/**
 * The variant of the button.
 */
export type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'link';

@Component({
  selector: 'button[app-button]',
  hostDirectives: [{ directive: NgpButton, inputs: ['disabled'] }],
  template: `
    <ng-content select="[slot=leading]" />
    <ng-content />
    <ng-content select="[slot=trailing]" />
  `,
  host: {
    '[attr.data-size]': 'size()',
    '[attr.data-variant]': 'variant()',
  },
  styles: `
    :host {
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      border: none;
      height: 2.5rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      transition: background-color 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      box-sizing: border-box;
      display: inline-flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      cursor: pointer;
      gap: 0.5rem;
    }

    :host[data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    :host[data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
    }

    :host[data-press] {

import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroCheckMini } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/mini';
import { NgpCheckbox } from 'ng-primitives/checkbox';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-checkbox',
  imports: [NgIcon, NgpCheckbox],
  providers: [provideIcons({ heroCheckMini })],
  styles: `
    [ngpCheckbox] {
      display: flex;
      width: 1.25rem;
      height: 1.25rem;
      cursor: pointer;
      align-items: center;

      flex: none;
      color: var(--ngp-text-inverse);
      font-size: 0.75rem;
    }

    [ngpCheckbox][data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    [ngpCheckbox][data-checked],
    [ngpCheckbox][data-indeterminate] {
      border-color: var(--ngp-background-inverse);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-inverse);
    }

    [ngpCheckbox][data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 2px;
    }
  `,
  template: `
    <span [(ngpCheckboxChecked)]="checked" ngpCheckbox>
      @if (checked()) {
        <ng-icon name="heroCheckMini" aria-hidden="true" />
      }
    </span>
  `,
})
export default class CheckboxExample {
  /**
   * The checked state of the checkbox.
   */
  readonly checked = signal(true);
}

```

## Import

Import the Checkbox primitives from `ng-primitives/checkbox`.

```ts
import { NgpCheckbox } from 'ng-primitives/checkbox';
```

## Usage

Assemble the checkbox directives in your template.

```html
<span ngpCheckbox [(ngpCheckboxChecked)]="checked">
  <ng-icon name="checkmark" aria-hidden="true" />
</span>
```

## Reusable Component

Create a reusable component that uses the `NgpCheckbox` directive.

## Schematics

Generate a reusable checkbox component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive checkbox
```

### Options

```

## Import

Import the Combobox primitives from `ng-primitives/combobox`.

```ts
import {
  NgpCombobox,
  NgpComboboxButton,
  NgpComboboxDropdown,
  NgpComboboxInput,
  NgpComboboxOption,
  NgpComboboxPortal,
} from 'ng-primitives/combobox';
```

## Usage

Assemble the combobox directives in your template.

```html
<div ngpCombobox>
  <input ngpComboboxInput />
  <button ngpComboboxButton>▼</button>
  <div ngpComboboxDropdown>
    @for (option of options; track option) {
    <div ngpComboboxOption [ngpComboboxOptionValue]="option">{{ option }}</div>
    }
  </div>
</div>
```

### Without Input Field

You can also create a combobox without an input field, which is useful for select-like behavior with keyboard navigation:

```html
<div ngpCombobox>
  <button ngpComboboxButton>{{ selectedOption || 'Select an option' }} ▼</button>
  <div ngpComboboxDropdown>
    @for (option of options; track option) {
    <div ngpComboboxOption [ngpComboboxOptionValue]="option">{{ option }}</div>
    }
  </div>
</div>
```

When no input is present, the combobox element itself becomes focusable and supports full keyboard navigation.

## Reusable Component

Create a reusable component that uses the `NgpCombobox` directive.

### Select All Functionality

The combobox supports a "Select All" option for multiple selection mode, allowing users to select or deselect all options at once.

#### Select All Features

- **Toggle All**: Click to select all options if not all are selected, or deselect all if all are selected
- **Visual State**: The "Select All" option shows as selected when all individual options are selected
- **Filtering Support**: When options are filtered, "Select All" only affects currently visible options
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with Arrow keys and Enter
- **Multiple Mode Only**: Automatically disabled in single selection mode

To implement Select All, use the special value `'all'` for your Select All option:

```html
<div ngpComboboxOptionValue="all" ngpComboboxOption>Select All</div>
```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable combobox component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive combobox
```

### Options

- `path`: The path at which to create the component file.
- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
- `exampleStyles`: Whether to include example styles in the generated component file. Defaults to `true`.

## API Reference

The following directives are available to import from the `ng-primitives/combobox` package:

### NgpCombobox

## Animations

The `ngpComboboxDropdown` primitive adds a CSS custom property `--ngp-combobox-transform-origin` to the element that can be used to animate the menu from the trigger element.

The `ngpComboboxDropdown` will also add the `data-enter` and `data-exit` attributes to the element when it is being added or removed from the DOM. This can be used to trigger animations.

```css
:host[data-enter] {
  animation: fade-in 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

:host[data-exit] {
  animation: fade-out 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

## Global Configuration

You can configure the default options for all comboboxes in your application by using the `provideComboboxConfig` function in a providers array.

```ts
import { provideComboboxConfig } from 'ng-primitives/combobox';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideComboboxConfig({ placement: 'bottom', container: document.body })],
});
```

### NgpComboboxConfig

<prop-details name="placement" type="'top' | 'right' | 'bottom' | 'left'">
  Define the placement of the combobox dropdown.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="container" type="HTMLElement" default="document.body">
  Define the container element for the combobox dropdown. This is useful for rendering the dropdown in a specific part of the DOM.
</prop-details>

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) guidelines for comboboxes.

### Keyboard Interactions

The combobox supports comprehensive keyboard navigation whether or not an input field is present:

#### With Input Field

- <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>: Open the dropdown and focus the first option. If the dropdown is already open, move focus to the next option.
- <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>: Open the dropdown and focus the last option. If the dropdown is already open, move focus to the previous option.
- <kbd>Home</kbd>: Move focus to the first option (when dropdown is open).
- <kbd>End</kbd>: Move focus to the last option (when dropdown is open).
- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Toggle the selection state of the focused option. In single selection mode, this will select the option and close the dropdown. In multiple selection mode, this will toggle the option without closing the dropdown.
- <kbd>Escape</kbd>: Close the dropdown without selecting an option.
- <kbd>Any character key</kbd>: Open the dropdown and filter options based on typed text.

#### Without Input Field

When no `ngpComboboxInput` is present, the combobox container becomes focusable and supports:

- <kbd>Tab</kbd>: Focus the combobox container.
- <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>: Open the dropdown and focus the first option. If already open, move to the next option.
- <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>: Open the dropdown and focus the last option. If already open, move to the previous option.
- <kbd>Home</kbd>: Move focus to the first option (when dropdown is open).
- <kbd>End</kbd>: Move focus to the last option (when dropdown is open).
- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Select the focused option and close the dropdown.
- <kbd>Escape</kbd>: Close the dropdown without selecting an option.

## Import

Import the DatePicker primitives from `ng-primitives/date-picker`.

```ts
import {
  NgpDatePicker,
  NgpDateRangePicker,
  NgpDatePickerLabel,
  NgpDatePickerNextMonth,
  NgpDatePickerPreviousMonth,
  NgpDatePickerGrid,
  NgpDatePickerCell,
  NgpDatePickerRowRender,
  NgpDatePickerCellRender,
  NgpDatePickerDateButton,
} from 'ng-primitives/date-picker';
```

## Usage

Assemble the date-picker directives in your template.

```html
<div ngpDatePicker>
  <div>
    <button ngpDatePickerPreviousMonth>...</button>
    <h2 ngpDatePickerLabel>...</h2>
    <button ngpDatePickerNextMonth>...</button>
  </div>
  <table ngpDatePickerGrid>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" abbr="Sunday">S</th>
        ...
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr *ngpDatePickerRowRender>
        <td *ngpDatePickerCellRender="let date" ngpDatePickerCell>
          <button ngpDatePickerDateButton>...</button>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

## Reusable Component

Create a reusable component that uses the date picker directives.

```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable date-picker component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive date-picker
```

### Options

- `path`: The path at which to create the component file.
- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
- `exampleStyles`: Whether to include example styles in the generated component file. Defaults to `true`.

## Examples

Here are some additional examples of how to use the Date Picker primitives.

### Date Range Picker

The date range picker allows users to select a range of dates by selecting the start and end dates.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, computed, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroChevronLeftMini, heroChevronRightMini } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/mini';

## API Reference

By default, the date picker uses the native JavaScript `Date` object, however the date picker is designed to work with any date library. To use a date library, such as Luxon, you need to specify the appropriate date adapter. The date adapter is an abstraction layer that allows components to use date objects from any date library, ensuring compatibility and easy integration. To learn more about the date adapter, see the [Date Adapter](/utilities/date-adapter) documentation.

The following directives are available to import from the `ng-primitives/date-picker` package:

### Keyboard Interactions

- <kbd>Space</kbd> - Selects the focused date.
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> - Selects the focused date.
- <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> - Moves focus to the same day of the previous week.
- <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> - Moves focus to the same day of the next week.
- <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd> - Moves focus to the previous day.
- <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd> - Moves focus to the next day.
- <kbd>Home</kbd> - Moves focus to the first day of the month.
- <kbd>End</kbd> - Moves focus to the last day of the month.
- <kbd>PageUp</kbd> - Moves focus to the same date in the previous month.
- <kbd>PageDown</kbd> - Moves focus to the same date in the next month.

## Global Configuration

You can configure the default options for all `NgpDatePicker` and `NgpDateRangePicker` calendars in your application by using the `provideDatePickerConfig` function in a providers array.

```ts
import { provideDatePickerConfig } from 'ng-primitives/date-picker';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideDatePickerConfig({
      firstDayOfWeek: 1, // Monday
    }),
  ],
});
```

### NgpDatePickerConfig

<prop-details name="firstDayOfWeek" type="NgpDatePickerFirstDayOfWeekNumber (1-7)">
  Sets which day starts the week in date picker and date range picker calendars.
  Accepts <code>1-7</code> where:
  <ul>
    <li><code>1</code>=Monday,</li>
    <li><code>2</code>=Tuesday,</li>
    <li><code>3</code>=Wednesday,</li>
    <li><code>4</code>=Thursday,</li>
    <li><code>5</code>=Friday,</li>
    <li><code>6</code>=Saturday,</li>
    <li><code>7</code>=Sunday (<code>default</code>).</li>
  </ul>
  Choose based on your users' cultural expectations - most international
  applications use <code>1</code> (Monday), while US applications typically use
  <code>7</code> (Sunday).
  <br />
  Note: When using a non-Sunday start day, update your calendar header column order accordingly.
</prop-details>

## Import

Import the Dialog primitives from `ng-primitives/dialog`.

```ts
import {
  NgpDialog,
  NgpDialogTitle,
  NgpDialogDescription,
  NgpDialogTrigger,
  NgpDialogOverlay,
} from 'ng-primitives/dialog';
```

## Usage

Assemble the dialog directives in your template.

```html
<button [ngpDialogTrigger]="dialog" ngpButton>Launch Dialog</button>

<ng-template #dialog let-close="close">
  <div ngpDialogOverlay>
    <div ngpDialog>
      <h1 ngpDialogTitle>Publish this article?</h1>
      <p ngpDialogDescription>
        Are you sure you want to publish this article? This action is irreversible.
      </p>
      <div class="dialog-footer">
        <button (click)="close()" ngpButton>Cancel</button>
        <button (click)="close()" ngpButton>Confirm</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</ng-template>
```

## Reusable Component

Create reusable components that uses the `NgpDialog` and `NgpDialogTrigger` directives.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component, input } from '@angular/core';
import {
  NgpDialog,
  NgpDialogDescription,
  NgpDialogOverlay,
  NgpDialogTitle,
  provideDialogState,
} from 'ng-primitives/dialog';

@Component({

### File Upload

File: primitives/file-upload.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/primitives/file-upload

# File Upload

The file upload primitive allows you to trigger a file upload from any element, giving you the more control over the appearance and behavior compared to the native file input.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroCloudArrowUp } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/outline';
import { NgpFileUpload } from 'ng-primitives/file-upload';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-file-upload',
  imports: [NgpFileUpload, NgIcon],
  providers: [provideIcons({ heroCloudArrowUp })],
  template: `
    <div
      (ngpFileUploadSelected)="onFilesSelected($event)"
      (ngpFileUploadRejected)="onFilesRejected()"
      ngpFileUploadFileTypes=".svg, .pdf"
      ngpFileUpload
      ngpFileUploadMultiple
    >
      <ng-icon name="heroCloudArrowUp" aria-hidden="true" />
      <p class="heading">Select or drag and drop files here.</p>
      <p class="subheading">Max file size: 10MB</p>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpFileUpload] {
      display: flex;
      cursor: pointer;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      row-gap: 0.25rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      border: 1px dashed var(--ngp-border-secondary);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      padding: 2rem 3rem;
    }

    [ngpFileUpload][data-dragover] {
      border-color: var(--ngp-border);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    ng-icon {
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      font-size: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 0.25rem;
    }

    .heading {
      font-size: 0.875rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      line-height: 1.25rem;
      text-align: center;
      margin: 0;
    }

    .subheading {
      font-size: 0.75rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-secondary);
      line-height: 1rem;
      text-align: center;
      margin: 0;
    }
  `,
})
export default class FileUploadExample {
  onFilesSelected(files: FileList | null): void {
    if (files) {
      alert(`Selected ${files.length} files.`);
    }
  }

  onFilesRejected(): void {
    alert('File type not supported.');
  }
}

```

## Import

Import the FileUpload primitives from `ng-primitives/file-upload`.

```ts
import { NgpFileUpload } from 'ng-primitives/file-upload';
```

## Usage

Assemble the file-upload directives in your template.

```html
<button
  ngpFileUpload
  (ngpFileUploadSelected)="onFilesSelected($event)"
  (ngpFileUploadCanceled)="onCancel()"
></button>
```

## Examples

### File Dropzone

The file dropzone primitive allows you to create a dropzone for files. This functionality is built into the file upload primitive, but can also be used separately if you don't want to show the file upload dialog on click.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpFileDropzone } from 'ng-primitives/file-upload';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-file-dropzone',
  imports: [NgpFileDropzone],
  template: `
    <div
      (ngpFileDropzoneSelected)="onFilesSelected($event)"
      (ngpFileDropzoneRejected)="onFilesRejected()"
      ngpFileDropzoneFileTypes=".svg, .pdf"
      ngpFileDropzone
    >
      <h3>Drag and drop files anywhere here!</h3>
      <p>But clicking won't open a file selection dialog.</p>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpFileDropzone] {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      padding: 2rem 3rem;
      flex-direction: column;
      row-gap: 0.25rem;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      border: 1px dashed var(--ngp-border-secondary);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      padding: 2rem 3rem;
    }

    [ngpFileDropzone][data-dragover] {
      border-color: var(--ngp-border);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    h3 {
      font-size: 0.875rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      line-height: 1.25rem;
      text-align: center;
      margin: 0;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 0.75rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-secondary);
      line-height: 1rem;
      text-align: center;
      margin: 0;
    }
  `,
})
export default class FileDropzoneExample {
  onFilesSelected(files: FileList | null): void {
    if (files) {
      alert(`Selected ${files.length} files.`);
    }
  }

  onFilesRejected(): void {
    alert('File type not supported.');
  }
}

```

## Reusable Component

Create a file upload component that uses the `NgpFileUpload` directive.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpFileUpload } from 'ng-primitives/file-upload';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-file-upload',
  hostDirectives: [
    {
      directive: NgpFileUpload,
      inputs: [
        'ngpFileUploadFileTypes:types',
        'ngpFileUploadMultiple:multiple',
        'ngpFileUploadDirectory:directory',
        'ngpFileUploadDragDrop:dragDrop',
        'ngpFileUploadDisabled:disabled',
      ],
      outputs: ['ngpFileUploadSelected:selected', 'ngpFileUploadCanceled:canceled'],
    },
  ],
  template: `
    Drop files here or click to upload
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: flex;
      cursor: pointer;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      row-gap: 0.25rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      border: 1px dashed var(--ngp-border-secondary);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      padding: 2rem 3rem;
    }

    :host[data-dragover] {
      border-color: var(--ngp-border);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }
  `,
})
export class FileUpload {}

```

### NgpFormControl

Typically this primitive would be not be used directly, but instead a more specific form control primitive would be used (e.g. `ngpInput`). All of our form control primitives use `ngpFormControl` internally so they will have the same accessibility features as described below.

The `NgpFormControl` directive is used to mark a form control element within a form field. This element will have an `aria-labelledby` attribute set to the ID of the label element within the form field and an `aria-describedby` attribute set to the ID of the description elements within the form field.

**Selector:** `[ngpFormControl]`

#### Inputs

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ngpFormControlDisabled` | `boolean` | `-` | Whether the form control is disabled by a parent. |

| `data-pristine` | Applied when the form control is pristine. |
| `data-dirty`    | Applied when the form control is dirty.    |
| `data-pending`  | Applied when the form control is pending.  |
| `data-disabled` | Applied when the form control is disabled. |

## Accessibility

The label and description elements should be associated with the form control using the `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes, respectively. This will ensure that screen readers can provide the necessary context to users.

### Icons

File: primitives/icons.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/primitives/icons

# Icons

Enhance your application by providing a visually appealing and intuitive way to represent actions, statuses, and features. Icons improve user experience, aid in navigation, and help convey information quickly.

We also maintain the popular [Angular Icons library](https://ng-icons.github.io/ng-icons) which gives you access to over 50,000 icons from popular icon libraries like Font Awesome, Material Design, Heroicons and more.

## Import

The `NgIcon` component is used to render icons in your application. To use icons, you need to import the `NgIcon` directive from `@ng-icons/core`.

Icons must be registered using the `provideIcons` function. The icons you want to use must be individually imported from their respective packages.

```ts
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { featherAirplay } from '@ng-icons/feather-icons';
import { heroUsers } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/outline';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <ng-icon name="featherAirplay" />
    <ng-icon name="heroUsers" />
  `,
  imports: [NgIcon],
  providers: [provideIcons({ featherAirplay, heroUsers })],
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

View the full list of available icons in the [Angular Icons documentation](https://ng-icons.github.io/ng-icons/#/browse-icons).

# Input

The input primitive can be used to enhance the accessibility of an input element and provide consistent interaction handling for hover, focus, press and autofill states.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpInput } from 'ng-primitives/input';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-input',
  imports: [NgpInput],
  template: `
    <input ngpInput type="text" placeholder="Enter your full name" />
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: contents;
    }

    [ngpInput] {
      height: 36px;
      width: 100%;
      border-radius: 8px;
      padding: 0 16px;
      border: none;
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-input-shadow);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      outline: none;
    }

    [ngpInput]:focus {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 2px;
    }

    [ngpInput]::placeholder {
      color: var(--ngp-text-placeholder);
    }
  `,
})
export default class InputExample {}

```

## Examples

### Multi-Select Listbox

The listbox can be configured to allow multiple selections.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroCheckSolid } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/solid';
import { NgpListbox, NgpListboxOption } from 'ng-primitives/listbox';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-listbox-multiple',
  imports: [NgpListbox, NgpListboxOption, NgIcon],
  providers: [provideIcons({ heroCheckSolid })],
  template: `
    <div [(ngpListboxValue)]="selection" ngpListbox ngpListboxMode="multiple">
      @for (option of options; track option.id) {
        <div [ngpListboxOptionValue]="option" ngpListboxOption>
          <ng-icon name="heroCheckSolid" size="16px" />
          {{ option.name }}
        </div>
      }
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpListbox] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      padding: 0.25rem;
      border-radius: 0.75rem;
      outline: none;
    }

    [ngpListboxOption] {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 0.5rem;
      padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;
      cursor: pointer;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      width: 200px;
      height: 36px;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-active] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }

    [ngpListboxOption] ng-icon {
      visibility: hidden;
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-selected] ng-icon {
      visibility: visible;
    }
  `,
})
export default class ListboxMultipleExample {
  readonly options: Option[] = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Marty McFly' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Doc Brown' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Biff Tannen' },
    { id: 4, name: 'Lorraine Baines' },
    { id: 5, name: 'George McFly' },
  ];

  readonly selection = signal<Option[]>([this.options[0], this.options[1]]);
}

interface Option {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

```

### Listbox with Sections

The listbox can be configured to have sections and headers.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroCheckSolid } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/solid';
import {
  NgpListbox,
  NgpListboxHeader,
  NgpListboxOption,
  NgpListboxSection,
} from 'ng-primitives/listbox';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-listbox-sections',
  imports: [NgpListbox, NgpListboxOption, NgpListboxSection, NgpListboxHeader, NgIcon],
  providers: [provideIcons({ heroCheckSolid })],
  template: `
    <div [(ngpListboxValue)]="selection" ngpListbox aria-label="Sections">
      @for (section of sections; track section.name) {
        <header class="listbox-header" ngpListboxHeader>{{ section.name }}</header>

        <div ngpListboxSection>
          @for (option of section.options; track option.id) {
            <div [ngpListboxOptionValue]="option" ngpListboxOption>
              <ng-icon name="heroCheckSolid" size="16px" />
              {{ option.name }}
            </div>
          }
        </div>
      }
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpListbox] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      padding: 0.25rem;
      border-radius: 0.75rem;
      list-style: none;
      outline: none;
      max-height: 300px;
      overflow-y: auto;
    }

    .listbox-header {
      padding: 0.25rem 0.75rem;
      font-weight: 600;
    }

    [ngpListboxOption] {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 0.5rem;
      padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;
      cursor: pointer;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      width: 200px;
      height: 36px;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-active] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }

    [ngpListboxOption] ng-icon {
      visibility: hidden;
    }

    [ngpListboxOption][data-selected] ng-icon {
      visibility: visible;
    }
  `,
})
export default class ListboxSectionsExample {
  readonly sections: Section[] = [
    {
      name: 'Characters',
      options: [
        { id: 1, name: 'Marty McFly' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Doc Brown' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Biff Tannen' },
        { id: 4, name: 'Lorraine Baines' },
        { id: 5, name: 'George McFly' },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'Locations',
      options: [
        { id: 6, name: 'Hill Valley' },
        { id: 7, name: 'Twin Pines Mall' },
        { id: 8, name: 'Lyon Estates' },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'Items',
      options: [
        { id: 9, name: 'DeLorean' },
        { id: 10, name: 'Hoverboard' },
        { id: 11, name: 'Sports Almanac' },
        { id: 13, name: 'Plutonium' },
        { id: 14, name: 'Mr. Fusion' },
        { id: 15, name: 'Flux Capacitor' },
      ],
    },
  ];

  readonly selection = signal<Option[]>([this.sections[0].options[0]]);
}

interface Section {
  name: string;
  options: Option[];
}

interface Option {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

```

import { NgpListbox, NgpListboxOption, NgpListboxTrigger } from 'ng-primitives/listbox';
import { NgpPopover, NgpPopoverTrigger } from 'ng-primitives/popover';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-listbox-select',
  imports: [
    NgpListbox,
    NgpLabel,
    NgpDescription,
    NgpListboxOption,
    NgpButton,
    NgpFormField,
    NgpPopover,
    NgpPopoverTrigger,
    NgpListboxTrigger,
    NgIcon,
  ],

      <button [ngpPopoverTrigger]="dropdown" ngpButton ngpListboxTrigger>
        {{ selection()[0].name }}
        <ng-icon name="heroChevronDownSolid" />
      </button>

      <ng-template #dropdown>
        <div [(ngpListboxValue)]="selection" ngpPopover ngpListbox aria-label="Characters">

        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(0.9);
      }
    }
  `,
})
export default class MenuExample {}

```

## Import

Import the Menu primitives from `ng-primitives/menu`.

```ts
import { NgpMenu, NgpMenuItem, NgpMenuTrigger, NgpSubmenuTrigger } from 'ng-primitives/menu';
```

## Usage

Assemble the menu directives in your template.

```html
<button [ngpMenuTrigger]="menu" ngpButton></button>

<ng-template #menu>
  <div ngpMenu>
    <button ngpMenuItem>Item 1</button>
    <button ngpMenuItem>Item 2</button>
    <button ngpMenuItem>Item 3</button>
  </div>
</ng-template>
```

## Reusable Component

Create reusable components that use the `NgpMenu` directive.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpMenu } from 'ng-primitives/menu';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-menu',
  hostDirectives: [NgpMenu],
  template: `
    <ng-content />
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      position: fixed;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      width: max-content;
      background: var(--ngp-background);
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-shadow);
      border-radius: 8px;
      padding: 4px;
      animation: menu-show 300ms ease-out;
    }

    :host[data-exit] {
      animation: menu-hide 300ms ease-out;
    }

    @keyframes menu-show {
      0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(0.9);
      }
      100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scale(1);
      }
    }

    @keyframes menu-hide {
      0% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scale(1);
      }
      100% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(0.9);
      }
    }
  `,
})
export class Menu {}

```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable menu component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive menu
```

### Options

- `path`: The path at which to create the component file.
- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
- `exampleStyles`: Whether to include example styles in the generated component file. Defaults to `true`.

## Examples

Here are some additional examples of how to use the Menu primitives.

### Submenu

The menu can contain submenus, which are nested menus that can be opened by hovering on a menu item.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroChevronRightMini } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/mini';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';
import { NgpMenu, NgpMenuItem, NgpMenuTrigger, NgpSubmenuTrigger } from 'ng-primitives/menu';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-menu-submenu',
  imports: [NgpButton, NgpMenu, NgpMenuTrigger, NgpMenuItem, NgpSubmenuTrigger, NgIcon],
  providers: [provideIcons({ heroChevronRightMini })],
  template: `
    <button [ngpMenuTrigger]="menu" ngpButton>Open Menu</button>

    <ng-template #menu>
      <div ngpMenu>
        <button ngpMenuItem>Item 1</button>
        <button ngpMenuItem>Item 2</button>
        <button [ngpSubmenuTrigger]="submenu" ngpMenuItem>
          Item 3
          <ng-icon name="heroChevronRightMini" />
        </button>
      </div>
    </ng-template>

    <ng-template #submenu>
      <div ngpMenu>
        <button ngpMenuItem>Item 1</button>
        <button ngpMenuItem>Item 2</button>
        <button ngpMenuItem>Item 3</button>
      </div>
    </ng-template>
  `,

        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(0.9);
      }
    }
  `,
})
export default class MenuExample {}

```

### Custom Offset

You can customize the offset using either a simple number or an object for more precise control:

```html
<!-- Simple number offset -->
<button [ngpMenuTrigger]="menu" ngpMenuTriggerOffset="12">Menu with 12px offset</button>

<!-- Object offset for precise control -->
<button
  [ngpMenuTrigger]="menu"
  [ngpMenuTriggerOffset]="{mainAxis: 8, crossAxis: 4, alignmentAxis: 2}"
>
  Menu with custom offset
</button>
```

## Styling

For the menu to be positioned correctly relative to the trigger element, it should use fixed positioning. For example, you can use the following CSS:

```css
[ngpMenu] {
  position: fixed;
}
```

## Animations

The `ngpMenu` primitive adds a CSS custom property `--ngp-menu-transform-origin` to the element that can be used to animate the menu from the trigger element.

The `ngpMenu` will also add the `data-enter` and `data-exit` attributes to the element when it is being added or removed from the DOM. This can be used to trigger animations.

```css
:host[data-enter] {
  animation: fade-in 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

:host[data-exit] {
  animation: fade-out 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

## Global Configuration

You can configure the default options for all menus in your application by using the `provideMenuConfig` function in a providers array.

```ts
import { provideMenuConfig } from 'ng-primitives/menu';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideMenuConfig({
      offset: 4,
      placement: 'top',
      flip: true,
      container: document.body,
      scrollBehavior: 'reposition',
    }),
  ],
});
```

### NgpMenuConfig

<prop-details name="offset" type="number | NgpOffsetOptions">
  Define the offset from the trigger element. Can be a number (applies to mainAxis) or an object with mainAxis, crossAxis, and alignmentAxis properties.
  
  **Number format:** `offset: 8` - Applies to mainAxis (distance from trigger)
  
  **Object format:** 
  ```ts
  offset: {
    mainAxis: 8,     // Distance between menu and trigger element
    crossAxis: 4,    // Skidding along the alignment axis  
    alignmentAxis: 2 // Same as crossAxis but for aligned placements
  }
  ```
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="placement" type="'top' | 'right' | 'bottom' | 'left'">
  Define the placement of the menu.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="flip" type="boolean">
  Define if the menu should flip when it reaches the edge of the viewport.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="container" type="HTMLElement">
  Define the container element for the menu. This is the document body by default.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="scrollBehavior" type="reposition | block">
Defines how the menu behaves when the window is scrolled. If set to `reposition`, the menu will adjust its position automatically during scrolling. Make sure the menu uses `position: absolute` in this mode. If set to `block`, scrolling will be disabled while the menu is open. In this case, the menu should use `position: fixed`.
</prop-details>

```

## Import

Import the Pagination primitives from `ng-primitives/pagination`.

```ts
import {
  NgpPagination,
  NgpPaginationButton,
  NgpPaginationFirst,
  NgpPaginationNext,
  NgpPaginationPrevious,
  NgpPaginationLast,
} from 'ng-primitives/pagination';
```

## Usage

Assemble the pagination directives in your template.

```html
<nav
  [(ngpPaginationPage)]="page"
  ngpPagination
  ngpPaginationPageCount="5"
  aria-label="Pagination Navigation"
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationFirst aria-label="First Page">
        <ng-icon name="heroChevronDoubleLeft" />
      </a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationPrevious aria-label="Previous Page">
        <ng-icon name="heroChevronLeft" />
      </a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationButton ngpPaginationButtonPage="1" aria-label="Page 1">1</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationButton ngpPaginationButtonPage="2" aria-label="Page 2">2</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationButton ngpPaginationButtonPage="3" aria-label="Page 3">3</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationButton ngpPaginationButtonPage="4" aria-label="Page 4">4</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationButton ngpPaginationButtonPage="5" aria-label="Page 5">5</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationNext aria-label="Next Page">
        <ng-icon name="heroChevronRight" />
      </a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a ngpPaginationLast aria-label="Last Page">
        <ng-icon name="heroChevronDoubleRight" />

export default class PopoverExample {}

```

## Import

Import the Popover primitives from `ng-primitives/popover`.

```ts
import { NgpPopover, NgpPopoverTrigger, NgpPopoverArrow } from 'ng-primitives/popover';
```

## Usage

Assemble the popover directives in your template.

```html
<button [ngpPopoverTrigger]="popover" (ngpPopoverTriggerOpenChange)="onPopoverStateChange($event)">
  Click me
</button>

<ng-template #popover>
  <div ngpPopover>Popover content</div>
</ng-template>
```

You can listen to the `ngpPopoverTriggerOpenChange` event to perform actions when the popover state changes. The event emits a boolean value indicating whether the popover is open or closed:

## Examples

### Custom Offset

You can customize the offset using either a simple number or an object for more precise control:

```html
<!-- Simple number offset -->
<button [ngpPopoverTrigger]="popover" ngpPopoverTriggerOffset="12">Popover with 12px offset</button>

<!-- Object offset for precise control -->
<button
  [ngpPopoverTrigger]="popover"
  [ngpPopoverTriggerOffset]="{mainAxis: 8, crossAxis: 4, alignmentAxis: 2}"
>
  Popover with custom offset
</button>
```

## Reusable Component

Create a popover component that uses the `NgpPopover` directive.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { injectPopoverContext, NgpPopover } from 'ng-primitives/popover';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-popover',
  hostDirectives: [NgpPopover],
  template: `
    {{ content() }}
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      position: absolute;
      max-width: 16rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-inverse);
      padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;
      border: none;

| `ngpPopoverTriggerDisabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Define if the trigger should be disabled. |
| `ngpPopoverTriggerPlacement` | `NgpPopoverPlacement` | `'top'` | Define the placement of the popover relative to the trigger. |
| `ngpPopoverTriggerOffset` | `NgpOffset` | `0` | Define the offset of the popover relative to the trigger.
Can be a number (applies to mainAxis) or an object with mainAxis, crossAxis, and alignmentAxis. |
| `ngpPopoverTriggerShowDelay` | `number` | `0` | Define the delay before the popover is displayed. |
| `ngpPopoverTriggerHideDelay` | `number` | `0` | Define the delay before the popover is hidden. |

#### Export As

`ngpPopoverTrigger`



#### Data Attributes

| Attribute       | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `data-open`     | Applied when the popover is open.     |
| `data-disabled` | Applied when the popover is disabled. |

### NgpPopoverArrow

The `NgpPopoverArrow` directive is used to add an arrow to the popover. It should be placed inside the popover content. It will receive `inset-inline-start` or `inset-block-start` styles to position the arrow based on the popover's placement. As a result it should be positioned absolutely within the popover content.

The arrow can be styled conditionally based on the popover's final placement using the `data-placement` attribute:

```css
[ngpPopoverArrow][data-placement='top'] {
  /* Arrow styles when popover is positioned on top */
}

[ngpPopoverArrow][data-placement='bottom'] {
  /* Arrow styles when popover is positioned on bottom */
}
```

## API Reference

### NgpPopoverArrow



**Selector:** `[ngpPopoverArrow]`

#### Export As

`ngpPopoverArrow`



### Data Attributes

| Attribute        | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `data-placement` | The final rendered placement of the popover. |

## Styling

For the popover to be positioned correctly relative to the trigger element, it must use absolute or fixed positioning. For example, you can use the following CSS:

```css
[ngpPopover] {
  position: absolute;
}
```

## Animations

The `ngpPopover` primitive adds a CSS custom property `--ngp-popover-transform-origin` to the element that can be used to animate the popover from the trigger element.

The `ngpPopover` will also add the `data-enter` and `data-exit` attributes to the element when it is being added or removed from the DOM. This can be used to trigger animations.

```css
:host[data-enter] {
  animation: fade-in 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

:host[data-exit] {
  animation: fade-out 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

## Global Configuration

You can configure the default options for all popovers in your application by using the `providePopoverConfig` function in a providers array.

```ts
import { providePopoverConfig } from 'ng-primitives/popover';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    providePopoverConfig({
      offset: 4,
      placement: 'top',
      showDelay: 0,
      hideDelay: 0,
      flip: true,
      container: document.body,
      closeOnOutsideClick: true,
      scrollBehavior: 'reposition',
    }),
  ],
});
```

### NgpPopoverConfig

<prop-details name="offset" type="number | NgpOffsetOptions">
  Define the offset from the trigger element. Can be a number (applies to mainAxis) or an object with mainAxis, crossAxis, and alignmentAxis properties.
  
  **Number format:** `offset: 8` - Applies to mainAxis (distance from trigger)
  
  **Object format:** 
  ```ts
  offset: {
    mainAxis: 8,     // Distance between popover and trigger element
    crossAxis: 4,    // Skidding along the alignment axis  
    alignmentAxis: 2 // Same as crossAxis but for aligned placements
  }
  ```
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="placement" type="'top' | 'right' | 'bottom' | 'left'">
  Define the placement of the popover.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="showDelay" type="number">
  Define the delay before the popover shows.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="hideDelay" type="number">
  Define the delay before the popover hides.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="flip" type="boolean">
  Define if the popover should flip when it reaches the edge of the viewport.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="container" type="HTMLElement">
  Define the container element for the popover. This is the document body by default.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="closeOnOutsideClick" type="boolean">
  Define whether the popover should close when clicking outside of it.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="scrollBehavior" type="reposition | block">
Defines how the popover behaves when the window is scrolled. If set to `reposition`, the popover will adjust its position automatically during scrolling. Make sure the popover uses `position: absolute` in this mode. If set to `block`, scrolling will be disabled while the popover is open. In this case, the popover should use `position: fixed`.
</prop-details>

    'Clara Clayton',
    'Needles',
    'Goldie Wilson',
    'Marvin Berry',
    'Lorraine Baines',
    'Strickland',
  ];

  /** The selected value. */
  readonly value = signal<string | undefined>(undefined);
}

```

## Import

Import the Select primitives from `ng-primitives/select`.

```ts
import {
  NgpSelect,
  NgpSelectDropdown,
  NgpSelectPortal,
  NgpSelectOption,
} from 'ng-primitives/select';
```

## Usage

Assemble the select directives in your template.

```html
<div ngpSelect>
  <div *ngpSelectPortal ngpSelectDropdown>
    <div ngpSelectOptionValue="option-1" ngpSelectOption>One</div>
    <div ngpSelectOptionValue="option-2" ngpSelectOption>Two</div>
    <div ngpSelectOptionValue="option-3" ngpSelectOption>Three</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Reusable Component

Create a reusable component that uses the `NgpSelect` directive.

```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable select component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive select
```

### Options

- `path`: The path at which to create the component file.
- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
- `exampleStyles`: Whether to include example styles in the generated component file. Defaults to `true`.

## Examples

Here are some additional examples of how to use the Select primitives.

### Select Form Field

The select can be used within a form field for better integration with form controls.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroChevronDown } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/outline';
import { NgpDescription, NgpFormField, NgpLabel } from 'ng-primitives/form-field';

  NgpSelect,
  NgpSelectDropdown,
  NgpSelectOption,
  NgpSelectPortal,
} from 'ng-primitives/select';

    NgpDescription,
  ],
  providers: [provideIcons({ heroChevronDown })],
  template: `

          <span class="select-value">{{ value }}</span>
        } @else {
          <span class="select-placeholder">Select an option</span>
        }
        <ng-icon name="heroChevronDown" />

        <div *ngpSelectPortal ngpSelectDropdown>
          @for (option of options; track option) {
            <div [ngpSelectOptionValue]="option" ngpSelectOption>
              {{ option }}

### Native Select

The native select is a simple wrapper around the native `select` element.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpNativeSelect } from 'ng-primitives/select';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-native-select',
  imports: [NgpNativeSelect],
  template: `
    <select ngpNativeSelect>
      <option value="24">24 hours</option>
      <option value="12">12 hours</option>
    </select>
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: contents;
    }

    select {
      all: unset;
      appearance: none;
      display: flex;
      width: 90%;
      align-items: center;
      height: 2.5rem;
      padding: 0 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      text-align: start;
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      outline: none;
      background-position-x: calc(100% - 10px);
      background-position-y: 50%;
      background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMCAyMCIgZmlsbD0iIzczNzM3MyI+PHBhdGggZmlsbC1ydWxlPSJldmVub2RkIiBkPSJNNS4yMiA4LjIyYS43NS43NSAwIDAgMSAxLjA2IDBMMTAgMTEuOTRsMy43Mi0zLjcyYS43NS43NSAwIDEgMSAxLjA2IDEuMDZsLTQuMjUgNC4yNWEuNzUuNzUgMCAwIDEtMS4wNiAwTDUuMjIgOS4yOGEuNzUuNzUgMCAwIDEgMC0xLjA2WiIgY2xpcC1ydWxlPSJldmVub2RkIj48L3BhdGg+PC9zdmc+');
      background-size: 1.25rem;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
    }

    select[data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    select[data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 0;
    }

    select[data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }
  `,
})
export default class NativeSelectExample {}

```

### Native Select Form Field

The select automatically integrates with the form field primitives.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpDescription, NgpFormField, NgpLabel } from 'ng-primitives/form-field';
import { NgpNativeSelect } from 'ng-primitives/select';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-native-select-form-field',
  imports: [NgpNativeSelect, NgpFormField, NgpLabel, NgpDescription],
  template: `
    <div ngpFormField>
      <label ngpLabel>Time Format</label>
      <p ngpDescription>Choose between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.</p>
      <select ngpNativeSelect>
        <option value="24">24 hours</option>
        <option value="12">12 hours</option>
      </select>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: contents;
    }

    [ngpFormField] {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      gap: 6px;
      width: 90%;
    }

    [ngpLabel] {
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      font-size: 0.875rem;
      line-height: 1.25rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      margin: 0;
    }

    [ngpDescription] {
      color: var(--ngp-text-secondary);
      font-size: 0.75rem;
      line-height: 1rem;
      margin: 0 0 4px;
    }

    select {
      all: unset;
      appearance: none;
      display: flex;
      width: 90%;
      align-items: center;
      height: 2.5rem;
      padding: 0 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      text-align: start;
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      outline: none;

    }

    select[data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }
  `,
})
export default class NativeSelectFormFieldExample {}

```

### Select with Custom Container

The select component can be rendered inside a custom container. You can open DevTools and inspect the DOM to see it mounted within this container.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroChevronDown } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/outline';
import {
  NgpSelect,
  NgpSelectDropdown,
  NgpSelectOption,
  NgpSelectPortal,
  provideSelectConfig,
} from 'ng-primitives/select';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-select-custom-container',
  imports: [NgpSelect, NgpSelectDropdown, NgpSelectOption, NgpSelectPortal, NgIcon],
  providers: [
    provideIcons({ heroChevronDown }),
    provideSelectConfig({
      container: '.select-container',
    }),
  ],
  template: `
    <div class="select-container"></div>

    <div [(ngpSelectValue)]="value" ngpSelect>
      @if (value(); as value) {
        <span class="select-value">{{ value }}</span>
      } @else {
        <span class="select-placeholder">Select an option</span>
      }
      <ng-icon name="heroChevronDown" />

      <div *ngpSelectPortal ngpSelectDropdown>
        @for (option of options; track option) {
          <div [ngpSelectOptionValue]="option" ngpSelectOption>

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpSeparator } from 'ng-primitives/separator';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-separator',
  imports: [NgpSeparator],
  template: `
    <p>The separator primitive can be used to separate content in a layout.</p>
    <div ngpSeparator></div>
    <p>It supports both horizontal and vertical orientations.</p>
  `,

# Switch

Perform state toggling.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpSwitch, NgpSwitchThumb } from 'ng-primitives/switch';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-switch',
  imports: [NgpSwitch, NgpSwitchThumb],
  styles: `
    [ngpSwitch] {
      position: relative;
      width: 2.5rem;
      height: 1.5rem;
      border-radius: 999px;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-secondary);
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      padding: 0;
      outline: none;
      transition-property:
        color, background-color, border-color, text-decoration-color, fill, stroke;
      transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      transition-duration: 150ms;
    }

    [ngpSwitch][data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
    }

    [ngpSwitch][data-checked] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-blue);
      border-color: var(--ngp-border-blue);
    }

    [ngpSwitchThumb] {

      background-color: white;
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      outline: none;
      transition: transform 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      transform: translateX(1px);
    }

    [ngpSwitchThumb][data-checked] {
      transform: translateX(17px);
    }
  `,
  template: `
    <button ngpSwitch>
      <span ngpSwitchThumb></span>
    </button>
  `,
})
export default class SwitchExample {}

```

## Import

Import the Switch primitives from `ng-primitives/switch`.

```ts
import { NgpSwitch, NgpSwitchThumb } from 'ng-primitives/switch';
```

## Usage

Assemble the switch directives in your template.

```html
<button ngpSwitch [(ngpSwitchChecked)]="checked">
  <span ngpSwitchThumb></span>
</button>
```

## Reusable Component

Create a reusable component that uses the switch directives.

  },
})
export class Switch implements ControlValueAccessor {
  /** Access the switch state. */
  private readonly switch = injectSwitchState();

  /** The on change callback */
  private onChange?: ChangeFn<boolean>;

  /** The on touched callback */
  protected onTouched?: TouchedFn;

  constructor() {
    // Any time the switch changes, update the form value.
    this.switch().checkedChange.subscribe(value => this.onChange?.(value));
  }

  /** Write a new value to the switch. */
  writeValue(value: boolean): void {
    this.switch().setChecked(value);
  }

  /** Register a callback function to be called when the value changes. */
  registerOnChange(fn: ChangeFn<boolean>): void {
    this.onChange = fn;
  }

  /** Register a callback function to be called when the switch is touched. */
  registerOnTouched(fn: TouchedFn): void {
    this.onTouched = fn;
  }

  /** Set the disabled state of the switch. */
  setDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {
    this.switch().setDisabled(isDisabled);
  }
}

```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable switch component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive switch
```

### Options

- `path`: The path at which to create the component file.
- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
- `exampleStyles`: Whether to include example styles in the generated component file. Defaults to `true`.

## Examples

Here are some additional examples of how to use the Switch primitives.

### Switch Form Field

The switch automatically integrates with the form field primitives.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpFormField, NgpLabel } from 'ng-primitives/form-field';
import { NgpSwitch, NgpSwitchThumb } from 'ng-primitives/switch';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-switch-form-field',
  imports: [NgpSwitch, NgpSwitchThumb, NgpFormField, NgpLabel],
  styles: `
    [ngpFormField] {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 1rem;
    }

    [ngpLabel] {
      font-weight: 500;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
    }

    [ngpSwitch] {
      position: relative;
      width: 2.5rem;
      height: 1.5rem;
      border-radius: 999px;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-secondary);
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      padding: 0;
      outline: none;
      transition-property:
        color, background-color, border-color, text-decoration-color, fill, stroke;
      transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      transition-duration: 150ms;
    }

    [ngpSwitch][data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
    }

    [ngpSwitch][data-checked] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-blue);
      border-color: var(--ngp-border-blue);
    }

      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      outline: none;
      transition: transform 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      transform: translateX(1px);
    }

### Table

File: primitives/table.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/primitives/table

# Table

While tables are a very common UI element, we currently do not provide a dedicated table primitive in Angular Primitives.

The main reason is that building a flexible, accessible, and fully-featured table component is a large and complex undertaking. There is already an excellent, battle-tested solution available: [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/framework/angular/).

TanStack Table is a headless table library that works very well alongside Angular Primitives. It provides all the core functionality you need for rendering tables (sorting, filtering, pagination, virtualization, etc.) without forcing a specific UI style, making it a perfect complement to our approach, and you can use it in conjunction with any of our UI primitives such as pagination etc.

## Why we don't provide a table primitive

**Complexity**: A table primitive is a large, feature-rich component that requires significant ongoing maintenance.

**No clear advantage**: TanStack Table already provides a highly capable solution. At the moment, we don't see how we could offer a better alternative.

**Focus on other primitives**: Our time and efforts are better spent providing primitives that don't already have great solutions elsewhere.

We may revisit this decision in the future, but for now, we recommend using TanStack Table alongside Angular Primitives for any table needs.

### Textarea

File: primitives/textarea.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/primitives/textarea

# Textarea

The textarea primitive can be used to enhance the accessibility of a textarea element and provide consistent interaction handling for hover, focus and press states.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpTextarea } from 'ng-primitives/textarea';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-textarea',
  imports: [NgpTextarea],
  template: `
    <textarea ngpTextarea placeholder="Enter your message"></textarea>
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: contents;
    }

    [ngpTextarea] {
      height: 72px;
      width: 90%;
      border-radius: 8px;
      padding: 8px 12px;
      border: none;
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-input-shadow);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      outline: none;
    }

    [ngpTextarea][data-focus] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 0px;
    }

    [ngpTextarea]::placeholder {
      color: var(--ngp-text-placeholder);
    }
  `,
})
export default class TextareaExample {}

```

## Import

Import the Textarea primitives from `ng-primitives/textarea`.

```ts
import { NgpTextarea } from 'ng-primitives/textarea';
```

## Usage

Assemble the textarea directives in your template.

```html
<textarea ngpTextarea></textarea>
```

## Reusable Component

Create an textarea component that uses the `NgpTextarea` directive.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpTextarea } from 'ng-primitives/textarea';

@Component({
  selector: 'textarea[app-textarea]',
  hostDirectives: [{ directive: NgpTextarea, inputs: ['disabled'] }],
  template: `
    <ng-content />
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      height: 72px;
      width: 90%;
      border-radius: 8px;
      padding: 8px 12px;
      border: none;
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-input-shadow);
      outline: none;
      font-family: inherit;
    }

    :host[data-focus] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 0;
    }

    :host::placeholder {
      color: var(--ngp-text-placeholder);
    }
  `,
})
export class Textarea {}

```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable textarea component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive textarea
```

### Options

- `path`: The path at which to create the component file.
- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
- `exampleStyles`: Whether to include example styles in the generated component file. Defaults to `true`.

## Examples

Here are some additional examples of how to use the Textarea primitive.

### Textarea Form Field

The textarea automatically integrates with the form field primitives.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpDescription, NgpFormField, NgpLabel } from 'ng-primitives/form-field';
import { NgpTextarea } from 'ng-primitives/textarea';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-textarea-form-field',
  imports: [NgpTextarea, NgpLabel, NgpDescription, NgpFormField],
  template: `
    <div ngpFormField>
      <label ngpLabel>Message</label>
      <p ngpDescription>Tell us about your favorite sandwich.</p>
      <textarea ngpTextarea placeholder="Enter your message"></textarea>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: contents;
    }

    [ngpFormField] {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      gap: 6px;
      width: 90%;
    }

    [ngpTextarea] {
      height: 72px;
      width: 90%;
      border-radius: 8px;
      padding: 8px 12px;
      border: none;
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-input-shadow);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      outline: none;
    }

    [ngpTextarea][data-focus] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 0px;
    }

    [ngpTextarea]::placeholder {
      color: var(--ngp-text-placeholder);
    }

    [ngpLabel] {
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      font-size: 0.875rem;
      line-height: 1.25rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      margin: 0;
    }

    [ngpDescription] {
      color: var(--ngp-text-secondary);
      font-size: 0.75rem;
      line-height: 1rem;
      margin: 0 0 4px;
    }
  `,
})
export default class TextareaFormFieldExample {}

  private readonly toastManager = inject(NgpToastManager);

  show(toast: TemplateRef<void>): void {
    this.toastManager.show(toast, { placement: 'bottom-end' });
  }
}

```

## Import

Import the Toast primitives from `ng-primitives/toast`.

```ts
import { NgpToast } from 'ng-primitives/toast';
```

## Usage

Assemble the toast directives in your template.

```html
<ng-template #toast>
  <div ngpToast>...</div>
</ng-template>
```

To show a toast, inject the `NgpToastManager` service and call the `show` method passing the toast template or a component
class that uses the `NgpToast` directive as a Host Directive.

```ts
import { NgpToastManager } from 'ng-primitives/toast';

export class MyComponent {
  private readonly toastManager = inject(NgpToastManager);

  showToast(): void {
    this.toastManager.show(toastTemplate);
    // or
    this.toastManager.show(MyToastComponent);
  }
}
```

## Reusable Component

Create a toast component that uses the `NgpToast` directive.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';
import { injectToastContext, NgpToast, NgpToastManager } from 'ng-primitives/toast';

# Toggle Group

The toggle group primitive is a collection of toggle buttons that can be used to select one or more options.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { heroBars3, heroBars3BottomLeft, heroBars3BottomRight } from '@ng-icons/heroicons/outline';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';
import { NgpToggleGroup, NgpToggleGroupItem } from 'ng-primitives/toggle-group';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-toggle-group',
  imports: [NgpToggleGroup, NgpToggleGroupItem, NgpButton, NgIcon],
  providers: [
    provideIcons({
      heroBars3BottomLeft,
      heroBars3,
      heroBars3BottomRight,
    }),
  ],
  template: `
    <div ngpToggleGroup aria-label="Text alignment">
      <button ngpButton ngpToggleGroupItem ngpToggleGroupItemValue="left" aria-label="Left align">
        <ng-icon name="heroBars3BottomLeft" />
      </button>

      <button
        ngpButton
        ngpToggleGroupItem
        ngpToggleGroupItemValue="center"
        aria-label="Center align"
      >
        <ng-icon name="heroBars3" />
      </button>

      <button ngpButton ngpToggleGroupItem ngpToggleGroupItemValue="right" aria-label="Right align">
        <ng-icon name="heroBars3BottomRight" />
      </button>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpToggleGroup] {
      display: flex;
      column-gap: 0.25rem;
      align-items: center;
      border-radius: 0.375rem;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      padding: 0.25rem;
    }

    [ngpToggleGroupItem] {
      display: flex;
      width: 2rem;
      height: 2rem;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      border-radius: 0.25rem;
      border: 1px solid transparent;
      background: transparent;
      outline: none;
      transition: background-color 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-sizing: border-box;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
    }

    [ngpToggleGroupItem][data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
      border-color: var(--ngp-border);
    }

    [ngpToggleGroupItem][data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
    }

    [ngpToggleGroupItem][data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }

    [ngpToggleGroupItem][data-selected] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-inverse);
      color: var(--ngp-text-inverse);
      border-color: transparent;
    }

    ng-icon {
      font-size: 1.125rem;
    }
  `,
})
export default class ToggleGroupExample {}

```

## Import

Import the ToggleGroup primitives from `ng-primitives/toggle-group`.

```ts
import { NgpToggleGroup, NgpToggleGroupItem } from 'ng-primitives/toggle-group';
```

## Usage

Assemble the toggle-group directives in your template.

```html
<div ngpToggleGroup>
  <button ngpToggleGroupItem ngpToggleGroupItemValue="1">Option 1</button>
  <button ngpToggleGroupItem ngpToggleGroupItemValue="2">Option 2</button>
  <button ngpToggleGroupItem ngpToggleGroupItemValue="3">Option 3</button>
</div>
```

## Reusable Component

Create a reusable component that uses the toggle group directives.

## Reusable Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ControlValueAccessor } from '@angular/forms';
import { injectToggleGroupState, NgpToggleGroup } from 'ng-primitives/toggle-group';
import { ChangeFn, provideValueAccessor, TouchedFn } from 'ng-primitives/utils';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-toggle-group',
  hostDirectives: [
    {
      directive: NgpToggleGroup,
      inputs: [
        'ngpToggleGroupOrientation:orientation',
        'ngpToggleGroupType:type',
        'ngpToggleGroupValue:value',
        'ngpToggleGroupDisabled:disabled',
      ],
      outputs: ['ngpToggleGroupValueChange:valueChange'],
    },
  ],
  template: `
    <ng-content />
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: inline-flex;
      column-gap: 0.25rem;
      align-items: center;
      border-radius: 0.375rem;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
      padding: 0.25rem;
    }
  `,
  providers: [provideValueAccessor(ToggleGroup)],
  host: {
    '(focusout)': 'onTouched?.()',
  },
})
export class ToggleGroup implements ControlValueAccessor {
  /** Access the toggle state. */
  private readonly toggleGroup = injectToggleGroupState();

  /** The on change callback */
  private onChange?: ChangeFn<string[]>;

  /** The on touched callback */
  protected onTouched?: TouchedFn;

  constructor() {
    // Any time the toggle group changes, update the form value.
    this.toggleGroup().valueChange.subscribe(value => this.onChange?.(value));
  }

  /** Write a new value to the toggle group. */
  writeValue(value: string[]): void {
    this.toggleGroup().setValue(value);
  }

  /** Register a callback function to be called when the value changes. */
  registerOnChange(fn: ChangeFn<string[]>): void {
    this.onChange = fn;
  }

  /** Register a callback function to be called when the toggle group is touched. */
  registerOnTouched(fn: TouchedFn): void {
    this.onTouched = fn;
  }

  /** Set the disabled state of the toggle group. */
  setDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {
    this.toggleGroup().setDisabled(isDisabled);
  }
}

```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable toggle group component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive toggle-group
```

### Options

- `path`: The path at which to create the component file.
- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
- `exampleStyles`: Whether to include example styles in the generated component file. Defaults to `true`.

## Examples

Here are some additional examples of how to use the Toggle Group primitives.

### Multiple Selection

The toggle group can be configured to allow multiple selections by setting the `ngpToggleGroupType` input to `multiple`.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core';
import {
  heroBold,
  heroItalic,
  heroStrikethrough,
  heroUnderline,
} from '@ng-icons/heroicons/outline';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-toggle',
  imports: [NgpToggle, NgpButton],
  template: `
    <button [(ngpToggleSelected)]="selected" ngpButton ngpToggle>Toggle</button>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpButton] {
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      border: none;
      outline: none;

      font-weight: 500;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      transition: background-color 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-button-shadow);
    }

    [ngpButton][data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    [ngpButton][data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 2px;
    }

    [ngpButton][data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);

  protected readonly content = injectTooltipContext<string>();
}

```

## Schematics

Generate a reusable tooltip component using the Angular CLI.

```bash npm
ng g ng-primitives:primitive tooltip
```

### Options

### Tooltip with Custom Container

The tooltip can be rendered inside a custom container. You can open DevTools and inspect the DOM to see it mounted within this container.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';
import {
  NgpTooltip,
  NgpTooltipArrow,
  NgpTooltipTrigger,
  provideTooltipConfig,
} from 'ng-primitives/tooltip';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-tooltip-custom-container',
  imports: [NgpTooltipTrigger, NgpTooltip, NgpTooltipArrow, NgpButton],
  providers: [
    provideTooltipConfig({
      container: '.tooltip-container',
    }),
  ],
  template: `
    <div class="tooltip-container"></div>

    <div class="examples">
      <button [ngpTooltipTrigger]="tooltip1" ngpButton type="button">
        Custom Container Tooltip
      </button>

### Custom Offset

You can customize the offset using either a simple number or an object for more precise control:

```html
<!-- Simple number offset -->
<button [ngpTooltipTrigger]="tooltip" ngpTooltipTriggerOffset="12">Tooltip with 12px offset</button>

<!-- Object offset for precise control -->
<button
  [ngpTooltipTrigger]="tooltip"
  [ngpTooltipTriggerOffset]="{mainAxis: 8, crossAxis: 4, alignmentAxis: 2}"
>
  Tooltip with custom offset
</button>
```

### NgpTooltipTrigger

## API Reference

### NgpTooltipTrigger

Apply the `ngpTooltipTrigger` directive to an element that triggers the tooltip to show.

**Selector:** `[ngpTooltipTrigger]`

#### Inputs

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ngpTooltipTrigger` | `string | NgpOverlayContent<T> | null` | `-` | Access the tooltip template ref. |
| `ngpTooltipTriggerDisabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Define if the trigger should be disabled. |
| `ngpTooltipTriggerPlacement` | `NgpTooltipPlacement` | `'top'` | Define the placement of the tooltip relative to the trigger. |
| `ngpTooltipTriggerOffset` | `NgpOffset` | `0` | Define the offset of the tooltip relative to the trigger.
Can be a number (applies to mainAxis) or an object with mainAxis, crossAxis, and alignmentAxis. |
| `ngpTooltipTriggerShowDelay` | `number` | `500` | Define the delay before the tooltip is displayed. |
| `ngpTooltipTriggerHideDelay` | `number` | `0` | Define the delay before the tooltip is hidden. |
| `ngpTooltipTriggerFlip` | `boolean` | `true` | Define whether the tooltip should flip when there is not enough space for the tooltip. |

| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `data-open`     | Applied when the tooltip is open.     |
| `data-disabled` | Applied when the tooltip is disabled. |

### NgpTooltipArrow

The `NgpTooltipArrow` directive is used to add an arrow to the tooltip. It should be placed inside the tooltip content. It will receive `inset-inline-start` or `inset-block-start` styles to position the arrow based on the tooltip's placement. As a result it should be positioned absolutely within the tooltip content.

The arrow can be styled conditionally based on the tooltip's final placement using the `data-placement` attribute:

```css
[ngpTooltipArrow][data-placement='top'] {
  /* Arrow styles when tooltip is positioned on top */
}

[ngpTooltipArrow][data-placement='bottom'] {
  /* Arrow styles when tooltip is positioned on bottom */
}
```

## API Reference

### NgpTooltipArrow



**Selector:** `[ngpTooltipArrow]`

#### Export As

`ngpTooltipArrow`



### Data Attributes

| Attribute        | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `data-placement` | The final rendered placement of the tooltip. |

## Using Text Content as Tooltip

The `useTextContent` input (enabled by default) allows the tooltip to automatically use the text content of the trigger element as the tooltip content. This is particularly useful for displaying full text when content is truncated with ellipsis.

```html
<!-- Simple usage - uses text content automatically -->
<div class="truncated-text" ngpTooltipTrigger>
  This text might be truncated with ellipsis and show the full content in the tooltip
</div>

<!-- Passing content directly takes precedence -->
<button [ngpTooltipTrigger]="myToolip">This won't show a tooltip unless content is provided</button>
```

### Important: Global Styles Required

When using the `useTextContent` feature or string values, the tooltip styles **must be global** and not encapsulated to the component. This is because the tooltip content is rendered in a portal outside of your component's scope.

```css
/* ✅ Global styles (in styles.css or with ViewEncapsulation.None) */
[ngpTooltip] {
  position: absolute;
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* ❌ Encapsulated styles won't work with useTextContent */
.my-component [ngpTooltip] {
  /* This won't be applied to text content tooltips */
}
```

If you need component-scoped styles, use template-based or component-based tooltips instead of `useTextContent`.

## Conditional Tooltips

The `showOnOverflow` input allows you to show tooltips only when the trigger element has overflowing content. This is particularly useful for text that might be truncated with ellipsis.

```html
<div
  class="truncated-text"
  appTooltipTrigger="This tooltip only shows when text overflows"
  ngpTooltipTriggerShowOnOverflow
>
  This text might be truncated
</div>
```

## Styling

For the tooltip to be positioned correctly relative to the trigger element, it must use absolute or fixed positioning. For example, you can use the following CSS:

```css
[ngpTooltip] {
  position: absolute;
}
```

## Animations

The `ngpTooltip` primitive adds a CSS custom property `--ngp-tooltip-transform-origin` to the element that can be used to animate the tooltip from the trigger element.

The `ngpTooltip` will also add the `data-enter` and `data-exit` attributes to the element when it is being added or removed from the DOM. This can be used to trigger animations.

```css
:host[data-enter] {
  animation: fade-in 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

:host[data-exit] {
  animation: fade-out 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

## Global Configuration

You can configure the default options for all tooltips in your application by using the `provideTooltipConfig` function in a providers array.

```ts
import { provideTooltipConfig } from 'ng-primitives/tooltip';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideTooltipConfig({
      offset: 4,
      placement: 'top',
      showDelay: 0,
      hideDelay: 500,
      flip: true,
      container: document.body,
      showOnOverflow: false,
      useTextContent: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### NgpTooltipConfig

<prop-details name="offset" type="number | NgpOffsetOptions" default="4">
Define the offset from the trigger element. Can be a number (applies to mainAxis) or an object with mainAxis, crossAxis, and alignmentAxis properties.

**Number format:** `offset: 8` - Applies to mainAxis (distance from trigger)

**Object format:**

```ts
offset: {
  mainAxis: 8,     // Distance between tooltip and trigger element
  crossAxis: 4,    // Skidding along the alignment axis
  alignmentAxis: 2 // Same as crossAxis but for aligned placements
}
```

</prop-details>

<prop-details name="placement" type="'top' | 'right' | 'bottom' | 'left'" default="top">
  Define the placement of the tooltip.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="showDelay" type="number" default="0">
  Define the delay before the tooltip shows.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="hideDelay" type="number" default="500">
  Define the delay before the tooltip hides.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="flip" type="boolean" default="true">
  Define if the tooltip should flip when it reaches the edge of the viewport.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="container" type="HTMLElement" default="document.body">
  Define the container element for the tooltip. This is the document body by default.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="showOnOverflow" type="boolean" default="false">
  Define if the tooltip should only show when the trigger element has overflowing content. This is useful for showing tooltips only when content is truncated.
</prop-details>

<prop-details name="useTextContent" type="boolean" default="true">
  Define whether to use the text content of the trigger element as the tooltip content. When enabled, the tooltip will automatically display the text content of the trigger element. Note that this requires global styles to work properly since the tooltip is rendered in a portal.
</prop-details>

## Utilities

### Autofill

File: utilities/autofill.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/utilities/autofill

# Autofill

Detect autofill events on input elements. This can be useful for styling or behavior changes when the browser autofills an input.
Floating labels are a common use case for this directive.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpAutofill } from 'ng-primitives/autofill';
import { NgpLabel } from 'ng-primitives/form-field';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-autofill',
  imports: [NgpAutofill, NgpLabel],
  template: `
    <form>
      <label ngpLabel for="address-one">
        Address line

        @if (autofilled()) {
          <span>(Autofilled)</span>
        }
      </label>
      <input
        id="address-one"
        (ngpAutofill)="autofilled.set($event)"
        autocomplete="address-line1"
        required
        type="text"
        name="address-one"
        placeholder="Enter your address"
      />
    </form>
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: contents;
    }

    form {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      gap: 6px;
      width: 90%;
    }

    [ngpLabel] {
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      font-size: 0.875rem;
      line-height: 1.25rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      margin: 0;
    }

    input {
      height: 36px;
      width: 90%;
      border-radius: 8px;
      padding: 0 16px;
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-shadow);
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      outline: none;
    }

    input:focus {
      box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgb(59, 130, 246);
    }

    input::placeholder {
      color: var(--ngp-text-tertiary);
    }

    span {
      color: var(--ngp-text-tertiary);
    }
  `,
})
export default class AutofillExample {
  /**
   * Store the autofill state.
   */
  readonly autofilled = signal(false);
}

```

### Date Adapter

File: utilities/date-adapter.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/utilities/date-adapter

# Date Adapter

The Date Adapter is an abstraction layer that allows components to use date objects from any date library, ensuring compatibility and easy integration.

## Import

Import the DateAdapter from `ng-primitives/date-time`.

```ts
import { NgpLuxonDateAdapter } from 'ng-primitives/date-time-lucon';
import { NgpDateAdapter, NgpNativeDateAdapter } from 'ng-primitives/date-time-luxon';
```

## Usage

Angular Primitives ships with two date adapters out of the box: `NgpNativeDateAdapter` and `NgpLuxonDateAdapter`.
The `NgpNativeDateAdapter` uses the native JavaScript `Date` object, while the `NgpLuxonDateAdapter` uses the Luxon date library.

To use a date adapter, you need to provide it to Angular's dependency injection system. This can be done once at the root of your application or at a component/module level.

```ts
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideDateAdapter(NgpLuxonDateAdapter)],
});
```

If no date adapter is provided, the `NgpNativeDateAdapter` will be used by default.

Should you need to use a different date library, you can create your own date adapter by implementing the `NgpDateAdapter` interface.

Should you wish to use the adapter in a component, you can inject it into a component.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DateTime } from 'luxon';
import { injectDateAdapter } from 'ng-primitives/date-time';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    ...
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  private readonly dateAdapter = injectDateAdapter<DateTime>();
}
```

## API Reference

All date adapters must implement the `NgpDateAdapter` interface.

```ts
interface NgpDateAdapter<T> {
  /**
   * Create a new date time object.
   */
  create(values: NgpDateUnits): T;

  /**
   * Create a new date with the current date and time.
   */
  now(): T;

  /**
   * Set the year of the date time object based on a duration.
   */
  set(date: T, values: NgpDateUnits): T;

  /**
   * Add a duration to the date time object.
   */
  add(date: T, duration: NgpDuration): T;

  /**
   * Subtract a duration from the date time object.
   */
  subtract(date: T, duration: NgpDuration): T;

  /**
   * Compare two date time objects.
   */
  compare(a: T, b: T): number;

  /**
   * Determine if two date time objects are equal.
   */
  isEqual(a: T, b: T): boolean;

  /**
   * Determine if a date time object is before another.
   */
  isBefore(a: T, b: T): boolean;

  /**
   * Determine if a date time object is after another.
   */
  isAfter(a: T, b: T): boolean;

  /**
   * Determine if two date objects are on the same day.
   */
  isSameDay(a: T, b: T): boolean;

  /**
   * Determine if two date objects are on the same month.
   */
  isSameMonth(a: T, b: T): boolean;

  /**
   * Determine if two date objects are on the same year.
   */
  isSameYear(a: T, b: T): boolean;

  /**
   * Get the year.
   */
  getYear(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the month.
   */
  getMonth(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the date.
   */
  getDate(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the day.
   */
  getDay(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the hours.
   */
  getHours(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the minutes.
   */
  getMinutes(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the seconds.
   */
  getSeconds(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the milliseconds.
   */
  getMilliseconds(date: T): number;

  /**
   * Get the first day of the month.
   */
  startOfMonth(date: T): T;

  /**
   * Get the last day of the month.
   */
  endOfMonth(date: T): T;

  /**
   * Get the start of the day.
   */
  startOfDay(date: T): T;

  /**
   * Get the end of the day.
   */
  endOfDay(date: T): T;
}
```

### Focus Trap

File: utilities/focus-trap.md
URL: https://angularprimitives.com/utilities/focus-trap

# Focus Trap

The Focus Trap utility is a directive that traps focus within a specified element. This is useful for modals, dropdowns, and other components that require focus to be contained within a specific area.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { NgpButton } from 'ng-primitives/button';
import { NgpFocusTrap } from 'ng-primitives/focus-trap';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-focus-trap',
  imports: [NgpFocusTrap, NgpButton],
  template: `
    <div [ngpFocusTrapDisabled]="disabled()" ngpFocusTrap>
      <button (click)="disabled.set(false)" ngpButton>Enable Focus Trap</button>
      <button (click)="disabled.set(true)" ngpButton>Disable Focus Trap</button>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: `
    [ngpFocusTrap] {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 1rem;
      padding: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
      border: 1px dashed var(--ngp-border);
      position: relative;
    }

    [ngpFocusTrap]::before {
      position: absolute;
      top: -1.5rem;
      left: 1rem;
      font-size: 0.75rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-secondary);
      content: 'Focus Trap Disabled';
    }

    [ngpFocusTrap][data-focus-trap]::before {
      content: 'Focus Trap Enabled';
    }

    [ngpButton] {
      padding-left: 1rem;
      padding-right: 1rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      color: var(--ngp-text-primary);
      border: 1px solid var(--ngp-border);
      outline: none;
      height: 2.5rem;
      font-weight: 500;
      background-color: var(--ngp-background);
      transition: background-color 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
      box-shadow: var(--ngp-shadow);
    }

    [ngpButton][data-hover] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-hover);
    }

    [ngpButton][data-focus-visible] {
      outline: 2px solid var(--ngp-focus-ring);
      outline-offset: 2px;
    }

    [ngpButton][data-press] {
      background-color: var(--ngp-background-active);
    }
  `,
})
export default class FocusTrapExample {
  /**
   * Whether the focus trap is disabled.
   */
  disabled = signal(true);
}

```

## Import
