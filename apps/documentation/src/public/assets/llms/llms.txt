# Angular Primitives

> Angular Primitives is a collection of unstyled, accessible Angular components and utilities for building design systems and web applications. Built with Angular, TypeScript, and a focus on accessibility, customization, and developer experience. It provides headless UI primitives that can be styled with any CSS framework or design system.

## Overview

- [Get Started](https://angularprimitives.com/getting-started/get-started): Angular Primitives is distributed as a single package with entrypoints for each primitive.

- [llms.txt](https://angularprimitives.com/getting-started/llms): Angular Primitives provides comprehensive documentation files optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI assistants.
- [Styling](https://angularprimitives.com/getting-started/styling): Unlike traditional component libraries, Angular Primitives doesn't come with any built-in styles.
- [Usage](https://angularprimitives.com/getting-started/usage): Angular Primitives are built entirely using Angular directives, offering a flexible and composable way to enhance your components.

- [Toggle](https://angularprimitives.com/primitives/toggle): Toggle a button on and off.

## Interactions

- [Focus Visible](https://angularprimitives.com/interactions/focus-visible): Determine whether an element should display a visible focus indicator and exposes the origin of that focus (keyboard, mouse, touch, program).
