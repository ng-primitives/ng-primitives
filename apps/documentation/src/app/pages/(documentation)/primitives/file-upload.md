# File Upload

The file upload primitive allows you to trigger a file upload from any element, giving you the more control over the appearance and behavior compared to the native file input.

<docs-example name="file-upload"></docs-example>

## Import

Import the FileUpload primitives from `ng-primitives/file-upload`.

```ts
import { NgpFileUpload } from 'ng-primitives/file-upload';
```

## Usage

Assemble the file-upload directives in your template.

```html
<button
  ngpFileUpload
  (ngpFileUploadSelected)="onFilesSelected($event)"
  (ngpFileUploadCanceled)="onCancel()"
></button>
```

## Examples

### File Dropzone

The file dropzone primitive allows you to create a dropzone for files. This functionality is built into the file upload primitive, but can also be used separately if you don't want to show the file upload dialog on click.

## Reusable Component

Create a file upload component that uses the `NgpFileUpload` directive.

```

- `prefix`: The prefix to apply to the generated component selector.
- `componentSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component class name.
- `fileSuffix`: The suffix to apply to the generated component file name. Defaults to `component`.
