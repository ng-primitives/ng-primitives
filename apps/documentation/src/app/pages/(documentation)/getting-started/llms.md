# llms.txt

Angular Primitives provides comprehensive documentation files optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI assistants. These files enable AI tools to understand the component library and provide better assistance with code generation, documentation, and implementation guidance.

## Available Files

### llms.txt

A structured index file that provides an overview of all components, organized by category. This file follows industry standards and includes direct links to the live documentation.

- **File Size:** ~8KB
- **Purpose:** Quick reference and component discovery
- **Best For:** Initial exploration and finding specific components

<a href="./assets/llms/llms.txt" download="llms.txt" class="download-button">
  Download llms.txt
</a>

### llms-full.txt

A comprehensive documentation file containing the complete content of all documentation pages, including:

- Full component documentation
- Complete TypeScript source code for reusable components
- API reference tables with inputs, outputs, and properties
- Usage examples and implementation details

The llms-full.txt file is ideal for in-depth understanding and reference when working with Angular Primitives, however, due to its size, it may consume more of your AI tool's context window.

- **File Size:** ~500KB
- **Purpose:** Complete reference with all implementation details
- **Best For:** In-depth analysis and code generation, offline use or use in environments with limited internet access

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

Enhance your Angular Primitives development with Cursor's `@Docs` feature:

1. Type `@Docs` in your chat prompt
2. Reference the Angular Primitives documentation: `https://angularprimitives.com/assets/llms/llms.txt`
3. Ask questions about specific primitives, implementation patterns, or accessibility features

Example: _"@Docs How do I implement a custom button using Angular Primitives button primitive?"_

### Windsurf

Integrate Angular Primitives documentation in Windsurf:

- Use `https://angularprimitives.com/assets/llms/llms.txt` in your prompts for direct reference
- Add the documentation URL to your `.windsurfrules` file for persistent access across sessions
- Leverage the comprehensive API documentation for accurate code generation

### ChatGPT & Claude

Maximize AI assistance when working with Angular Primitives:

- Specify that you're building with **Angular Primitives** (headless UI library)
- Include the documentation URL: `https://angularprimitives.com/assets/llms/llms.txt` in your conversations
- The AI can then provide context-aware suggestions for primitive usage, accessibility patterns, and Angular-specific implementations

### GitHub Copilot

Copilot doesn't currently support external documentation, but you can still enhance its suggestions by:

- Mentioning that you're using **Angular Primitives** in your code comments
- Providing snippets of relevant documentation in your comments for context
